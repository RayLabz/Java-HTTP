# Java-HTTP
A utility library that makes HTTP requests easier to work with.

The Java HTTP library simplifies the execution of HTTP requests in Java through standardization. It allows you to quickly build a request using a builder pattern, add parameters, execute the request and receive a response and its data. While standardizing the aspects of HTTP requests, the library still maintains some versatility, allowing you to a) define request headers and read response headers and b) define request timeouts.

<b>The package requires Java 8+</b>
